# iterative_impeller_testing
Narrowing down many combinations of impeller properties to find the top 10 combinations for 4 different goals which include:

1. The best inner blockage factor

2. The best outer blockage factor

3. The smallest difference in alignment between the outlet velocity angle and the volute spiral angle

4. The smallest difference between the velocity at the exit from the rotor and the velocity at the volute spiral
